# Book-Listing-App
an app that lists books.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. You will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the Android Basics course. They include:

Fetching data from an API
Using an AsyncTask
Parsing a JSON response
Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.

## 

When user  enters a keyword, press the search button, they recieve a list of published books which relate to that keyword.

To achieve this, I'll make use of the Google Books API. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.
Here is the link to a typical Request of the Google Books API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=homodeus&maxResults=3
